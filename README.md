### WORK DONE SO FAR: 

- Studied the Jaeger cpp client, deployed HOTROD application present in Go language and see how tracing is done, in
  jaeger UI.
- Made a simple hello world instrumentation code using Jaeger-cpp-client (https://github.com/dexter816/jaeger-hello-world)  
- Studied the project related resources present

      -  talk-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHoI9F9bZeM   
      -  proposal-https://github.com/BU-NU-CLOUD-SP18/Ceph-Tracing 
      -  blog-https://superuser.openstack.org/articles/end-to-end-tracing-with-ceph-and-jaeger/  
      -  research paper and other projects with similar problem statement such as _opencensus-jaeger
         instrumentation_. 
         
- Studied, modified and worked on how modular configuration jaeger provides with the examples
  present in opentracing and jaeger client( will do the web socket instrumentation to deepen this
  understanding.) 
  
- Took inspiration and worked out the distributed tracing example
  https://github.com/dexter816/distributed-tracing-example/tree/master/src/dist_tracing 
  
- Currently working on instrumenting a branch of Ceph, along with studying how tracing endpoints
  are employed using bilkn with lttng tracing in ceph.

### WILL DO BEFORE THE PROJECT BEGINS: 

- How when Openstack is deployed in ceph the tracing is done using blkin, lttng and debugging.

- Study( started ) Mania and Aliâ€™s work and trace endpoints replaced so far, discuss the bottlenecks such as how tracing
  can interfere with core functions of Ceph and try look for some solutions with the team.
